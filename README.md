# Iris-Flower-Classification-

## Introduction:

In this beginner's mini-project, I have implemented various Classification Algorithms of Machine Learning on Fisher's Iris Data to predict the species of a new sample of Iris flower.
This project uses UCI repository as the dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris.

## Features:
1. Length of the sepals
2. Width of the sepals
3. Length of the petals
4. Width of the petals


## Predicted Attribute (Target Variable):

Different species of Iris Plant



## Purpose:

To gain exposure to Machine Learning Classification concepts along with data visualization.
